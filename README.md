This contains a Python implementation of a Fibonacci sequence generator using a generator function. The code allows users to input the number of terms they want to generate from the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is then printed in a clean, space-separated format. This project is a great example of how to use Python generators for efficient memory usage, especially when dealing with infinite sequences. It's ideal for beginners looking to understand generators, as well as for anyone interested in exploring mathematical sequences in Python. Feel free to clone, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of Python's capabilities!
